# Note about policies and logging:
#	This file contains an explicit policy for every combination of
#	zones defined in this sample.  This is solely for the purpose of
#	providing more specific messages in the logs.  This is not
#	necessary for correct operation of the firewall, but greatly
#	assists in diagnosing problems. The policies below are logically
#	equivalent to:
#
#	loc	net		ACCEPT
#	net	all		DROP		info
#	all	all		REJECT		info
#
#	The Shorewall-perl compiler will generate the individual policies
#	below from the above general policies if you set 
#	EXPAND_POLICIES=Yes in shorewall.conf.
