# If your Shorewall configuration requires detection of the ip address of a ppp

# to wait until the interface is configured. Otherwise the script will fail
# because it won't be able to detect the IP address.

# Example:
#    wait_interface="ppp0"
# or
#    wait_interface="ppp0 ppp1"
# or, if you have defined  in /etc/shorewall/params
