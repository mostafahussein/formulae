# 
# This file is used to define the hosts that are accessible when the firewall is
# stopped or is being stopped.
# 
# Warning
# 
# Changes to this file do not take effect until after the next shorewall start or
# shorewall restart command.
# 
# The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a
# different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate
# specification syntax).
# 
# INTERFACE - interface
# 
#     Interface through which host(s) communicate with the firewall
# 
# HOST(S) (hosts) - [-|address[,address]...]
# 
#     Optional. Comma-separated list of IP/subnet addresses. If your kernel and
#     iptables include iprange match support, IP address ranges are also allowed.
# 
#     If left empty or supplied as "-", 0.0.0.0/0 is assumed.
# 
# OPTIONS - [-|option[,option]...]
# 
#     Optional. A comma-separated list of options. The order of the options is
#     not important but the list can contain no embedded whitespace. The
#     currently-supported options are:
# 
#     routeback
# 
#         Set up a rule to ACCEPT traffic from these hosts back to themselves.
#         Beginning with Shorewall 4.4.9, this option is automatically set if
#         routeback is specified in shorewall-interfaces (5) or if the rules
#         compiler detects that the interface is a bridge.
# 
#     source
# 
#         Allow traffic from these hosts to ANY destination. Without this option
#         or the dest option, only traffic from this host to other listed hosts
#         (and the firewall) is allowed. If source is specified then routeback is
#         redundant.
# 
#     dest
# 
#         Allow traffic to these hosts from ANY source. Without this option or
#         the source option, only traffic from this host to other listed hosts
#         (and the firewall) is allowed. If dest is specified then routeback is
#         redundant.
# 
#     notrack
# 
#         The traffic will be exempted from conntection tracking.
# 
# PROTO (Optional) ‒ protocol-name-or-number
# 
#     Protocol.
# 
# DEST PORT(S) (dport) ‒ service-name/port-number-list
# 
#     Optional. A comma-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from
#     /etc/services. May also include port ranges of the form low-port:high-port
#     if your kernel and iptables include port range support.
# 
# SOURCE PORT(S) (sport) ‒ service-name/port-number-list
# 
#     Optional. A comma-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from
#     /etc/services. May also include port ranges of the form low-port:high-port
#     if your kernel and iptables include port range support.
# 
# Note
# 
# The source and dest options work best when used in conjunction with
# ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes in shorewall.conf(5).
# 
# Example
# 
# Example 1:
# 
#             #INTERFACE      HOST(S)                 OPTIONS         PROTO          DEST       SOURCE
#             #                                                                      PORT(S)    PORT(S)
#             eth2            192.168.1.0/24
#             eth0            192.0.2.44
#             br0             -                       routeback
#             eth3            -                       source
#             eth4            -                       notrack        41
